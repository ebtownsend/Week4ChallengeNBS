## What Was The Challenge?

To create a calculator and add functionality for (+, -, *, /, +-, Clear, =).
Stretch goals - create functionality fot (Memory - clear, recall, +, -).

## How I expected the challenge to go?

I expected the challenge to be difficult as there is a lot of functionality and nuances with leading zeros, displaying and storing input values.

## What Went Well?

I was able to work out & implement the logic for the core functionality for the calculator, including figuring out the tricky logic behind not including leading zeros and working out the functionality for the +- button.

## What Didn't...

Attempting to work out the functionality for the memory buttons was difficult, expecially as there was not clear specification of what these buttons should do / what their desired functionality is.

## Possible Improvements 

More clear instructions for desired functionality.
